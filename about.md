Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website! Here you’ll find my resume, coding projects, writing pieces, and my aspirations. I encourage you to explore the work I have done and learn who I really am. If you want to know a little bit more about who I am, keep reading!

First, I am a hardcore *Star Trek* fan. I’ve seen almost all episodes from every series and almost every movie. Don’t believe me? Here is a photo of me sitting in the captain’s seat at Trekonderoga. I’m also a fan of *Avatar: The Last Air Bender*, *Legend of Korra*, and even *Xena: Warrior Princess*. My go to music preferences are musicals and acapella. If I’m not jamming out to *Hamilton* or *Dear Evan Hansen*, I’m most certainly listening to the Nor’easters or Pentatonix.
Besides movies and musicals, I’m also a gamer (hence being Head Coach of the Varsity Overwatch team at Champlain College Esports) and an avid reader. Although I really do enjoy the field of Data Analytics, I have a secret hope that one day I will be a world-famous writer.
