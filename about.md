# Who is the author?

Gale Proulx, that's who! I'm a senior at Champlain College majoring in Data Analytics. Unfortunately, school doesn't give me nearly as many opportunities as I want to creatively write, so this is my outlet. (What? I know I picked the wrong major...)

Onwards to the next question!

# What is this website?

As mentioned before, you will be find creative work in various genres as well as pieces still being worked on, such as my book Unintentional Calamity.

# Can I publish your work elsewhere?

Ask first! I'm not opposed to the idea, but you need my explicit permission. Feel free to email me at galeproulx@gmail.com with any questions. I promise I won't bite (hard)!

# Is there any space for other writers?

Yes! I wouldn't mind publishing other people's work on this website. You would still get credit and have full rights to your piece. In other words, if you wanted to modify or remove your piece, you could! Collaboration is a beautiful thing, and there is no way I'm getting in the way of a good piece.
