title: Democratize Data Now, Ask Questions Later

Data Science is an underdeveloped field. There are no industry standards. Although online courses exist, few address key problems such as ethics. As an incoming Data Analyst, I have trouble analyzing my own results! Despite all of these pitfalls of Data Science, there is increased demand and hype for the democratization of data; a demand that seems to have come a couple of years too early.

## What does "the democratization of data" mean?

The democratization of data is a call for Data Science to be commonly accessible. Rather than highering a Data Scientist, the average person should be able to gather their own insights from a large dataset. Ideally, all data would be anonymized and accessible to anyone. No one would have to worry about being identified and everyone could benefit from looking at the same data. Larger companies would not have an edge over smaller companies simply because they have more data.

In order to achieve this idealistic future, everyone not already studying to become a Data Scientist needs assistance. More specifically, everyone needs a program to do most of the data analysis for them. If people can gain insights without doing the dirty work, then the whole process of data analysis becomes more accessible. Accessibility is a huge plus as more eyes on the same data set can give different perspectives and conclusions.

This concept is not new. In fact, one of the original programs that made small amounts of data more accessible sits in most peoples' computers today: Microsoft Excel. Up until spreadsheet software, people had to do a lot of calculations by hand or with specialized software. It wasn't easy to make a spreadsheet of information and crunch numbers through a formula in an automated fashion. When Microsoft Excel came into existence, computers suddenly had the capability of automatically calculating numbers without the need for programming skills. You didn't have to be a computer scientist to get the numbers you wanted. Making complex calculations became accessible.

New software today is trying to do the same thing. Whether it's SPSS, Tableau, or Splunk, there are companies trying to make data analysis easier. Unfortunately, unlike the calculations Microsoft Excel can make (which are relatively small) these newer programs are making predictions about much bigger data sets. Big data itself has grander implications. The field of Data Science has a greater impact than spreadsheet software. Due to this key difference, we start running into some problems.

## Data Democratization is Not Ready Yet

While Data Science gets lots of hype by increasing company profits and giving valuable insight, it also gets a lot of flack. Facebook in 2018 got the most attention for its poor handling of data. Netflix has even made mistakes by posting on Twitter information about its user base that was unintentionally mean.

Even trained professionals can struggle to make predictions that are accurate and ethical. In an age where news is constantly questioned for being fake, it seems like a poor time to democratize data. Data Science is an underdeveloped field and putting untrained eyes on new data is an awful idea. Anyone can have the best of intentions when analyzing data and still accidentally perpetuate stereotypes and make incorrect conclusions. Until the Data Science community can agree upon standards and procedures for cleaning and producing results, the community cannot build the program for everyone to use.

It feels like everyday people are calling out for the democratization of data without knowing the implications of what they are asking. Until Data Science becomes an actual science, it only feels appropriate to let this idea rest and refocus our efforts towards a more ethical future. Once ethics are down, then it might be time to pick up from where we left off.
