Using Laravel as my PHP framework again, I decided I could adapt the ProDocument system I made to be a new DND system. Users have inventories and stats that will be calculated based off of nodes unlocked off a sphere grid. Much of this project was inspired based off of Final Fantasy X and its Sphere Grid. Dynamically creating the sphere grid by far has been the hardest part of this project.
