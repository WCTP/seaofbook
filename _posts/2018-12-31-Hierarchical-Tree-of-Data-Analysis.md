In the year 2018, it feels like many industry professionals got so carried away with the hype of big data that few people remember that Data Science is still an underdeveloped field. It is true that Data Science is backed up by statistics, computer science, and other fields depending on the context, but there is no scientific process that aids people in discovering correlations. Taking a step back, Data Science departments have no standardized structure. Each company's solution for handling data differs from place to place.  Due to this lack of standardization, we are now stuck in situations such as Cambridge Analytica, where even a company as big as Facebook can't handle all the information they are receiving. To avoid future violations of basic ethics, it is important to define what the Data Science department members are, and how they work together.

## Data Engineer

Data Scientists are held with such high regard because this field has the most visibility. If a Data Scientist does their job right, they will change the business they work for and increase profits or insights. Unfortunately, Data Engineer's can't say the same thing. When a Data Engineer does their job perfectly, the only people who will notice are Data Analysts and Data Scientists. Storing a lot of data is not hard, but storing it in an organized fashion is a challenge. There is a reason why Google's Search Engine beats all others: they know how to sift through ungodly amounts of data in a very short amount of time. A Data Engineer's role in this search is giving a database that can be easily searched through. They can control how the data is stored, how each piece of data is connected. Ultimately, they can also dictate how easy a Data Analyst's life is by deciding how missing information is stored. The control the lens that a Data Analyst looks through.

## Data Analyst

Once the data is held in a database and easily retrieved, the Data Engineer can throw that newly generated data to the analyst of the team. Data Analysts are the first line of defense in finding important information. An analyst should be able to clean the data up and explore this new field of data. Depending on what a company wants, the analyst should be able to find out if they can achieve the goal. Additionally, they can make some predictions and write up a report to pass up to the Data Scientist.

## Data Scientist

Finally, the data that has been diligently collected and carefully analyzed can be thrown to the Data Scientist. A Data Scientist's role is to analyze results and make tools when needed. Data Analysts might make predictions that are questionable, or write reports that don't go into enough depth. A Data Scientist should have the high-level skills to really understand the algorithms behind the analysis. Most importantly, a Data Scientist should be able to see the ethical pitfalls of the current project. Once the Data Science polishes the results, they can submit it to the Data Product Manager.

## Data Product Manager

Throughout this whole process, the Data Product Manager should be overseeing the process and making sure the analysis that is conducted meets the goals set by an outside source. Data Product Managers are the bridge between an audience that knows nothing about Data Science and the team that is conducting the analysis. Data Product Managers should always look at the final report, making sure all audiences will understand what was written. Additionally, the product manager should make sure the team is not overstating their results.

## The Collaborative Process

From start to finish, the Data Science department should be aware of what other people in their department are doing. If possible, the team should get an expert in the field they are analyzing to ensure they are not making unreasonable assumptions. For example, a Data Science team working with data from a medical field could misinterpret a column or have unreasonable expectations for predicting accuracy. Every dataset requires context to be interpreted.

When this collaborative process finishes, then a company should be able to get the report they want. This ideal department should be able to scale with the size of a company by adding specializations or combining roles. Hopefully, this approach will be adopted by more industry leaders until this is finally common practice. This step in the right direction might eventually lead the field of Data Science from being a field of guesswork to a methodical science.
